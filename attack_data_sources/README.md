# MITRE ATT&CK

## Description
This part of the OSSEM project focuses on the documentation of ATT&CK data sources suggested or associated with techniques defined in the [Enterprise Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique_Matrix). In addition, here is where ATT&CK data sources will be mapped with specific sub data sources defined in the [Detection Data Model](/detection_data_model) with the main goal of creating a link between ATT&CK data sources and event logs.

The methodology follows the next steps:

* Exploring ATT&CK data sources
* Documenting event logs related to ATT&CK data sources
* Develop a data model
* Map event logs to ATT&CK data sources
