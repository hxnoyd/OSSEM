# MITRE ATT&amp;CK

## Description
This part of the OSSEM project focuses on the documentation of ATT&amp;CK data sources suggested or associated with techniques defined in the https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique_Matrix. In addition, here is where ATT&amp;CK data sources will be mapped with specific sub data sources defined in the /detection_data_model with the main goal of creating a link between ATT&amp;CK data sources and event logs.
