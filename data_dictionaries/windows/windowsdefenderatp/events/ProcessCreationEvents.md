|process_parent_user_logon_id|InitiatingProcessLogonId|string|Identifier for a logon session of the process that initiated the event. This identifier is unique on the same machine only between restarts.||
|process_parent_integrity_level|InitiatingProcessIntegrityLevel|string|Integrity level of the process that initiated the event. Windows assigns integrity levels to processes based on certain characteristics, such as if they were launched from an internet download. These integrity levels influence permissions to resources.||
