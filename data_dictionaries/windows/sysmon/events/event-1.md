# Event ID 1: Process creation

## Description
The process creation event provides extended information about a newly created process. The full command line provides context on the process execution. The ProcessGUID field is a unique value for this process across a domain to make event correlation easier. The hash is a full hash of the file with the algorithms in the HashType field.<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon#event-id-1-process-creation">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon#event-id-1-process-creation</a>
