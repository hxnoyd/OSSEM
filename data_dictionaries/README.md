# Data Dictionaries

## Description
This part of the OSSEM project contains specific information about several security event logs organized by operating system and their respective data sets. Each dictionary describes a single event log and its corresponding event field names. The difference between the [Common Information Model](../common_information_model/) folder and the data dictionaries is that in the CIM the field definitions are more general whereas in a data dictionary, each field name definition is unique to the specific event log.
