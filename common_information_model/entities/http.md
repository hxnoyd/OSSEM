# HTTP Schema
Event fields used to define metadata about HTTP information. This is based on information in the layer 7 (HTTP) application, however can also include HTTP information from an endpoint/server.
IIS, Apache, NGINX, proxy logs, and other variances of logs that have HTTP information would go in here.
Also, if the HTTP connection is from a decrypted/MITM HTTPS/TLS session then portions of that information, where applicable, would go in here.

## Data Fields
