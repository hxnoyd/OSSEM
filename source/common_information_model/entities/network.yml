title: Network Schema
description: Event fields used to define metadata about network information seen in
  a typical OSI layer. This includes data both from an endpoint as well as a network
  monitoring device/application (NSM, Firewall, IPS, IDS, etc...). This differentiates
  from data that is specific to Source and Destination specific information such as
  Source or Destination bytes, packets, IP address, mac address, TCP flags.
data fields:
- standard name: network_bytes
  type: long
  description: Total bytes for the session. If this field does not exist in the log
    source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine the source and destination
    bytes
  sample value: '102034'
- standard name: fingerprint_network_community_id
  type: string
  description: Network community ID as outlined by the standard from https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec.
    Standardized hashing of network tuple. The combination, most commonly, of Source
    IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port, and IP Protocol allows pivoting
    between multiple log types
  sample value: 1:EeVyZ07VGj1n0rld+xCLFdM+u8M=
- standard name: network_initiated
  type: boolean
  description: 'Whether the session was initiated or received. Most commonly used
    in relation to an endpoint/device. False = the endpoint did not initiate the session
    (ie: was scanned or RDP connection made to it)'
  sample value: 'True'
- standard name: network_ip_bytes
  type: long
  description: Total IP bytes, according to ip headers, for the session. If this field
    does not exist in the log source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine
    the source and destination IP bytes
  sample value: '14564'
- standard name: network_missed_bytes
  type: long
  description: bytes that a network sensor or other system/application may have missed
  sample value: '5'
- standard name: network_packets
  type: long
  description: Total packets for the session. If this field does not exist in the
    log source, then its possible in your ETL pipeline to combine the source and destination
    packets
  sample value: '143'
- standard name: network_application
  type: string
  description: 'Layer 7 (application) in the OSI model. Ex: HTTP,SMB,FTP,SSH, etc'
  sample value: HTTP
- standard name: network_protocol
  type: string
  description: 'Transport layer in the OSI model. Also known as, IP Protocol. Ex:
    TCP,UDP,ICMP,ICMP-v6, etc. Convert to lowercase'
  sample value: tcp
resources: []
