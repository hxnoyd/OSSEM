description: 'Event fields used to define metadata about HTTP information. This is
  based on information in the layer 7 (HTTP) application, however can also include
  HTTP information from an endpoint/server.

  IIS, Apache, NGINX, proxy logs, and other variances of logs that have HTTP information
  would go in here.

  Also, if the HTTP connection is from a decrypted/MITM HTTPS/TLS session then portions
  of that information, where applicable, would go in here.'
data_fields:
- standard_name: http_request_header_names

  description: List of any additional (or all) HTTP headers. Because a client can
    use any HTTP header they want and there are already hundreds of (common HTTP headers)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers]
    it would be impossible to define a specfic field for each one.
