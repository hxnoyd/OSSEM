title: Destination Schema
description: Event fields used to define the destination (server) in a network connection
  event.
data fields:
- standard name: dst_bytes
  type: integer
  description: network bytes sent by the dst_ip_addr
  sample value: '100'
- standard name: dst_host_name
  type: string
  description: The destination server, host, hostname, domain, or domain name. Some
    examples, would include the TLS server name, HTTP Host, DNS Query Name, etc. For
    information on how to define and use this field refer to the documentation additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md
  sample value: www.google.com
- standard name: dst_domain
  type: string
  description: If there is a clear distinction of the domain VS hostname VS FQDN this
    is the domain field. More often than not this should NOT be used and should be
    defined in the ./target.md, ./host.md, or ./user.md. However, you may follow the
    recommendations additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md if there is
    a clear example for this
  sample value: bigwheel.corporation.local
- standard name: dst_fqdn
  type: string
  description: If there is a clear distinction of the domain VS hostname VS FQDN this
    is the FQDN field. More often than not this should NOT be used and should be defined

    additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md if there is a clear example
