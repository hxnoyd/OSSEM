description: Event fields used to define the destination (server) in a network connection
  event.
data_fields:
- standard_name: dst_bytes
  field_name: ''
  type: integer
  description: network bytes sent by the dst_ip_addr
  sample_value: '100'
- standard_name: dst_host_name
  field_name: ''
  type: string
  description: The destination server, host, hostname, domain, or domain name. Some
    examples, would include the TLS server name, HTTP Host, DNS Query Name, etc. For

- standard_name: dst_domain
  field_name: ''
  type: string
  description: If there is a clear distinction of the domain VS hostname VS FQDN this
    is the domain field. More often than not this should NOT be used and should be
    defined in the ./target.md, ./host.md, or ./user.md. However, you may follow the
    recommendations additional-guidelines/domain_or_hostname_or_fqdn.md if there is
    a clear example for this
