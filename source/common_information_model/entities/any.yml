title: Any Schema
description: 'Fields used to define metadata for a single field to include data from
  multiple fields with similar/same values/data.  This data is most commonly created
  from an ETL pipeline.<br>

  Any fields below that contain a ''*'' indicates those are searches and not actual
  fields (key/values). This is because certain values are not desirable to copy/duplicate.
  However, because of a common schema we can still find are values for a specific
  common type, without duplicating or copying everything to one field!  '
