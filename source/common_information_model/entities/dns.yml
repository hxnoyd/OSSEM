  \ data in logs that contain DNS queries. \nIncluding, but not limited to, Zeek dns.log,\
  \ Suricata DNS, Sysmon EventID 22, Windows DNS debug/trace logs.<br>\nIn the verbiage\
  \ below, request is used to denote the client (or fowarded address if applicable)\
  \ that is making the DNS request. This would commonly be the client/source that\
  \ is looking up a domain.<br>\nThe response/answer, is used to denote the server\
  \ that responded with the answer or responded to the request/client.<br>\nIt is\
  \ important to remember that in DNS logs their are multiple servers that may be\
  \ involved in the response. This is similar to how packets are forwarded through\
  \ routers."
