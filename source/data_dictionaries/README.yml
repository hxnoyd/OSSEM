title: Data Dictionaries
description: This part of the OSSEM project contains specific information about several
  security event logs organized by operating system and their respective data sets.
  Each dictionary describes a single event log and its corresponding event field names.
  The difference between the ../common_information_model/ folder and the data dictionaries
  is that in the CIM the field definitions are more general whereas in a data dictionary,
  each field name definition is unique to the specific event log.
