title: 'Event ID 400: Engine Lifecycle'
operating system: windows
data channel: powershell
description: 'Logs the start and stop of PowerShell. Each time that PowerShell executes
  - either upon the execution of a single command, the start of a local session, or
  the start of a remoting session - this log records an Event ID (EID) 400 message:
  "Engine state is changed from None to Available." At the completion of the session,
  the log records an EID 403 event: "Engine state is changed from Available to Stopped".

  The message details for both EID 400 and EID 403 events include a HostName field.
  If executed locally, this field will be logged as HostName=ConsoleHost. If PowerShell
  remoting is in use, the accessed system will record these events with HostName=ServerRemoteHost."https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Kazanciyan-Investigating-Powershell-Attacks-WP.pdf'
