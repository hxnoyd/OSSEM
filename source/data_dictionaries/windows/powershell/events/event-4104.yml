title: 'Event ID 4104: Script Block Logging'
operating system: windows
data channel: powershell
description: Script block logging records blocks of code as they are executed by the
  PowerShell engine, thereby capturing the full contents of code executed by an attacker,
  including scripts and commands. Due to the nature of script block logging, it also
  records de-obfuscated code as it is executed. For example, in addition to recording
  the original obfuscated code, script block logging records the decoded commands
  passed with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand argument, as well as those obfuscated with
  XOR, Base64, ROT13, encryption, etc., in addition to the original obfuscated code.
  Script block logging will not record output from the executed code. https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/02/greater_visibilityt.html
