title: 'Event ID 10: ProcessAccess'
operating system: windows
data channel: sysmon
description: The process accessed event reports when a process opens another process,
  an operation that's often followed by information queries or reading and writing
  the address space of the target process. This enables detection of hacking tools
  that read the memory contents of processes like Local Security Authority (Lsass.exe)
  in order to steal credentials for use in Pass-the-Hash attacks. Enabling it can
  generate significant amounts of logging if there are diagnostic utilities active
  that repeatedly open processes to query their state, so it generally should only
  be done so with filters that remove expected accesses.https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon#event-id-10-processaccess
