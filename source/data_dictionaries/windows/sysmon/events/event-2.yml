title: 'Event ID 2: A process changed a file creation time'
operating_system: windows
data_channel: sysmon
description: The change file creation time event is registered when a file creation
  time is explicitly modified by a process. This event helps tracking the real creation
  time of a file. Attackers may change the file creation time of a backdoor to make
  it look like it was installed with the operating system. Note that many processes
  legitimately change the creation time of a file; it does not necessarily indicate
  malicious activity.<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon#event-id-2-a-process-changed-a-file-creation-time">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon#event-id-2-a-process-changed-a-file-creation-time</a>
