title: 'Event ID 4769: A Kerberos service ticket was requested'
operating system: windows
data channel: security
description: This event generates every time Key Distribution Center gets a Kerberos
  Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket request. This event generates only on domain
  controllers. If TGS issue fails then you will see Failure event with Failure Code
  field not equal to "0x0". You will typically see many Failure events with Failure
  Code "0x20", which simply means that a TGS ticket has expired. These are informational
  messages and have little to no security relevance.
