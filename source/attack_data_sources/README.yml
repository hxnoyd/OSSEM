title: MITRE ATT&amp;CK
description: This part of the OSSEM project focuses on the documentation of ATT&amp;CK
  data sources suggested or associated with techniques defined in the https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique_Matrix.
  In addition, here is where ATT&amp;CK data sources will be mapped with specific
  sub data sources defined in the /detection_data_model with the main goal of creating
  a link between ATT&amp;CK data sources and event logs.
