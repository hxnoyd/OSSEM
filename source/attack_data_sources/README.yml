title: MITRE ATT&CK
description: |-
  This part of the OSSEM project focuses on the documentation of ATT&CK data sources suggested or associated with techniques defined in the [Enterprise Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique_Matrix). In addition, here is where ATT&CK data sources will be mapped with specific sub data sources defined in the [Detection Data Model](/detection_data_model) with the main goal of creating a link between ATT&CK data sources and event logs.

  The methodology follows the next steps:

  * Exploring ATT&CK data sources
  * Documenting event logs related to ATT&CK data sources
  * Develop a data model
  * Map event logs to ATT&CK data sources
